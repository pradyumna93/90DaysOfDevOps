DevOps is a methodology that involves a set of practices and tools for improving collaboration and communication between development and operations teams. The goal of DevOps is to increase the speed and reliability of software delivery by automating the process of building, testing, and deploying software. This is achieved through the use of tools such as continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), infrastructure as code, and monitoring and logging. By implementing DevOps practices, organizations can reduce the time it takes to bring new features and updates to their customers, while also increasing the stability and security of their systems.
